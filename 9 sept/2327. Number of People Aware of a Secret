On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.
Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Solution:
class Solution {
    public int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];  // dp[i] = new people on day i
        dp[1] = 1;
        long sharing = 0; // active sharers count

        for (int day = 2; day <= n; day++) {
            // People who start sharing today
            if (day - delay >= 1) {
                sharing = (sharing + dp[day - delay]) % mod;
            }
            // People who forget today
            if (day - forget >= 1) {
                sharing = (sharing - dp[day - forget] + mod) % mod;
            }
            // New people who learn today
            dp[day] = sharing;
        }

        // Count people who still remember on day n
        long ans = 0;
        for (int day = n - forget + 1; day <= n; day++) {
            if (day >= 1) ans = (ans + dp[day]) % mod;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
