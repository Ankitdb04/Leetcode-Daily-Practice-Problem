No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:
a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
 Solution: Time complexity is O(logn)
 class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int a=n/2;
        int b=n-a;
        while(!nozero(a) || !nozero(b)){

            a++;
            b--;
        }
        return new int [] {a,b};
        
    }
    private boolean nozero(int x){
        while(x>0){
            if(x%10==0) return false;
            x/=10;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
